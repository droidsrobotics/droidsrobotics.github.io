On September 27, 2019, we were finally assigned a team number.  

During our seven years in FIRST LEGO League, we were Team 8024, 74, 91 and 51. Now, we are back to the 8000's as a rookie FIRST Robotics Competition team.

We are also registered for events. Look out for us at both Miami Valley Regional and the Greater Pittsburgh Regional.  Now beging the hard part...funding.
