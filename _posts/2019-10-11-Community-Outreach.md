Emily Brittain Elementary School is a small K-4 school in Butler, PA with about 250 students. The population served by the school has the highest poverty rates of the district.

We were invited by the school principal to be part of their Fun Fall Festival on October 11. Four of our team members attended the 2.5 hour event at the school. She told us that her students do not get such opportunities. We decided to take several different MINDSTORMS robots to engage the audience. Not one person we talked to had seen LEGO MINDSTORMS or heard of FIRST. We hope that our visit inspired many children.

More than 350 people attended the event and raised $2300 for the school.

We are proud to establish ties with and support our local communities.
