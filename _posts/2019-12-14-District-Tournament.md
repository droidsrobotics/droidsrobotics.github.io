On December 14, two of our students and two of our mentors represented the team at the District FIRST LEGO League tournament at University of Akron. We enjoyed being judges and being able to make a difference in the larger FIRST community.

We also had the additional honor of being the Keynote speakers at opening ceremonies. Our goal was to show the students how important participation in FIRST is and inspire them to keep on going in their journey. 

Here are some excerpts:

> FIRST makes the impossible possible. Because of FIRST we have accomplished so much. It has opened doors and led us to places we could have never imagined. - Sanjay

> As you compete here today, remember that anything is possible. Sometimes, we just may not see it at that time. Whether or not you have your perfect robot run or win an award today, know that you have discovered something about yourself and your community this year. - Arvind
