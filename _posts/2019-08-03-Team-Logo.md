### Team Logo

We received our first team shirt. We don't have a team number yet. The gears in our logo will eventually have a number added to them by the end of the year.

The rebel alliance logo represents both our Star Wars-themed name and an alliance between multiple FIRST teams. Most of our team are FIRST LEGO League alumni from three teams. The rivets and gears represent FIRST Robotics Competition. The orange represents Sharon, PA.  Together, the logo represents who we are - a team with a strong FIRST background, a team that believes in Collaboration and a team that believes in Community.
