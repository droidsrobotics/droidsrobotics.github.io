On November 23rd, we went to Austintown, OH to help FRC 3193 with their FIRST LEGO League Qualifier.  It was a great day! Four students and two adults from our team volunteered at this event. The adults judged, while the rest of us helped with the robot game.

Two of our team members, Sanjay and Arvind, were invited to be referees, as they knew all the FIRST LEGO League missions and rules already. The robot matches were exciting to watch. In the morning, teams had a practice round. After lunch, each of the teams had three official rounds.

Ananth and Jacob were responsible for managing the practice tables during the day. The practice tables were located in the pit area. Their job was to make sure that teams were gracious at the tables and that all teams were given equal time to practice.

We ended the day being part of the High 5 line.

Thank you to FIRST Senior Mentor, Andy Yantes, and Falco Tech 3193 for inviting us to be part of the event. It was a great experience and an honor to be able to spend time with FIRST LEGO League teams and give back to a new community.
