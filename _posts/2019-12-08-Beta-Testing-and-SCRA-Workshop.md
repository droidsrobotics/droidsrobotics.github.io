Earlier in the year, we had been selected to be one of the beta testers for the new FRC 2020 Control System. We were greatly honored to be selected despite being a rookie team. 

On December 8, we ran a workshop for Steel City Robotics Alliance (SCRA) teams. During the hour-long workshop we shared our insights, findings and tips with eight regional FIRST Robotics Competition Teams from Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
