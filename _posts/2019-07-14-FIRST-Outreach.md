### FIRST Outreach

Half our team (Ramsey, Ben, Lucas, Sanjay and Arvind) spent Saturday, November 13, at Mountain State Invitational where we taught three workshops and ran an Expert Zone area for teams attending Mountain State Invitational (MSI). MSI is an international FIRST LEGO League Open Invitational for 62 teams from North and South America.

We were able to collaborate with multiple FIRST teams at this event. We collaborated with students from Avi and Friends (FRC), Category 5 (FRC), Tiger Techs (FLL), LEGO Legion (FLL) and Twisted Toys (FLL).

In addition, two of our team members, Sanjay and Arvind, volunteered at the event for three full days (July 12-14). In addition to teaching the workshops, they were asked by the Tournament Director to give a speech to teams about the importance of Cooperition.
